          Alexander Hamilton was an American statesman, politician, legal
          scholar, military commander, lawyer, banker, and economist. He was one
          of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential
          interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the
          founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the
          United States Coast Guard, and the New York Post newspaper. As the
          first secretary of the treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the
          economic policies of George Washington's administration. He took the
          lead in the Federal government's funding of the states' debts, as well
          as establishing the nation's first two de facto central banks, the
          Bank of North America and the First Bank of the United States, a
          system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain. His
          vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous
          executive branch, a strong commercial economy, government-controlled
          banks, support for manufacturing, and a strong military.
